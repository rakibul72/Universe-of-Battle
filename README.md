# Universe-of-Battle
It is a multi-player fighting game.There are two characters,each having their own power.There are total three rounds in a match with three different arenas.The time of every rounds game-play is 2 minutes.Winner of a round gets 100 points and the player who wins consecutive three rounds of a match will get 200 points as bonus.There is a practice session outside the game by which the user can improve his skills.There is also a leader-board to show the highest scorer’s in a sorted manner.We kept three different background music’s  for practice session,match-time and menu.
We used total 7 header files and used those for different aspects.
